I am a scientist 👨‍🔬 broadly interested in understanding the processes driving individual 👤 and collective decisions 👥 in social groups. 
Specifically, I am fascinated by the interplay between social interactions and individual and collective decisions.</br>
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuguid/people/group-leaders/prof-laurent-keller.html">Prof. Laurent Keller's group</a>
at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland 🇨🇭, where I'm working on a variety of ant species 🐜🐜🐜.</br>
My research currently involves a combination of behavioural observations and experiments 🕵️‍♂️, agent-based simulations 🖥️, network analysis and pose estimation.</br></br>
